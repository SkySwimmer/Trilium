This release is based on previous release v0.98.0-noai, just code improvements on top of them

This is a custom release to fix custom code patches, it is not present in the upstream.

Changes in v0.98.1:
- Fixed the automatic websocket reconnect causing duplicate reconnects if the initial reconnect takes longer than one second
- Changed the connection status popups so they wont be shown on desktop builds, thats an internal server anyways
- Changed the connection loss popups so they only will show if a reconnect attempt fails or if reconnect takes longer than 5 seconds, so that eg. waking from sleep mode wont show the loss popup unless its unable to reestablish a connection

The changes made have been ported to the `forked` branch so they will be included in a potential pr to upstream.
