This release is based on previous release v0.98.0-noai, just custom code on top of them

This is a custom release to fix custom code patches and introduce a new feature, it is not present in the upstream.

Changes in v0.98.4:
- Fixed the severe editing lag introduced by the reconnect handler patch, there was a case where the awaits during editing were slowing down the requests to the remote server, so removed the secondary blob call and merged the blob data refresh into the PUT .../data request, improving the performance
- Implemented local-sided (so per-session) tab management and tree expansion, meaning that the note tree elements expand on one client, wont be expanded on the second, as a partial multi-user support feature (so your tabs and note expansion wont bug other users on the same trilium instance), this can however be disabled under Options -> Other should you wish the previous logic to be used
- Implemented further partial local-option support, its not fully finished or used yet but in the future this can mean per-client themes and customization support

I am aware there was an upstream release, ill try to port to it shortly.

Also i apologize about having gone out of sync with upstream versioning, in future builds ill be using the upstream version numbering, but with minor release numbers on top instead of what ive been doing now to denote custom updates (so eg. v0.98.2.1 for a build on our end, based on upstream v0.98.2, tho this likely wont be until the next major release to avoid issues with machine-based version comparison)
