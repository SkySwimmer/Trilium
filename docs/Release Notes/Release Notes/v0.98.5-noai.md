Port to upstream release https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/v0.98.1

As usual, all credits go to the upstream developers, weve simply removed AI integration

This build does include the patches of our non-upstream build v0.98.4.1 which unfortunately didnt release due to an issue with the version label, ill try to fix that, but for now just use this version.
