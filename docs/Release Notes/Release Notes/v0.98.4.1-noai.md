This release is based on previous release v0.98.4-noai, just code improvements on top of them

This is a custom release to fix custom code patches, it is not present in the upstream.

Changes in v0.98.4.1:
- Fixed note tree expansion breaking whenever local note tree expansion was enabled, the bug caused issues where the note tree would be blank (eg. options would have no entries at all), this was fixed by letting the server send all child objects regardless of them being expanded should local tree expansion be enabled
- Also reintroduced code that selects the initial note whenever theres no set of open tabs providing the last active note, this fixes some render issues with newly-connected clients where they dont have a initial note selected, so things are a bit cleaner
- Made it so changing settings under "Per-session options" wont cause a refresh of the session, instead it will in the background update the options on all clients
- While this doesnt affect the current build due to not actually having any other "Per-session options" aside from tabs and tree expansion, for cases like local-sided theme selection, there now is code to make sure that switching off using such "per-session options" will refresh the options ui to add/remove the selectors for switching between server/local-sided option values without needing to refresh

Apologies about the immediate patch, local testing didnt reveal the presence of the bug until i actually tried it on a clean trilium, which didnt have any notes expanded actively server-sided
